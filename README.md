# UFNF Engine Launcher
This is the official launcher for UFNF engine where you can select mods and any version of UFNF you want to play.

## HOW TO ADD YOUR MOD
**There are some things you need to name specifically!**
- make sure your .exe file is named ``Funkin.exe``
- make sure your zip file name matches up with the name you will put into the list

1. take all your mod's files and put them in a zip file. make sure compression is turned off!
2. upload your files to dropbox
3. fork this repository
4. add your mod to the list in versions>index.html like this: ``NAME-VERSION:www.DROPBOX.LINK/ENDING/IN?dl=1``
5. make a new folder for your mod in versions
6. add a changelog.txt file and specify what is different in this version compared to the last
7. make a pull request to this repository with your update.

> Side note: if you want to upload an update please remove the previous version!
> Only mods made in UFNF are accepted!
> Please put your mod behind the latest UFNF version so the list kinda looks like this: `LATEST-UFNF:LINK,YOUR-MOD:LINK,OLDER-MOD:LINK,OLDER-UFNF:LINK`
